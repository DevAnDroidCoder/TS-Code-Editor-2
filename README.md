#### Things to remember
- Please use Sketchware pro only to edit files and upload them with swb files.
- Please do not use the GitHub web interface to modify app files.
- If you are modifying the app in Android only then please use MGit or Termux for committing files.
- Do not forget to upload the swb file of the Sketchware pro project with a pull request(Remember to include used custom blocks and local lib in the swb file).
- Please do not forget to check whether the app builds successfully or not before creating a pull request.
- If you added local libraries, please implement them in `/app/build.gradle`.
- If you are using Android only I highly recommend you to use [AndroidIDE](https://github.com/AndroidIDEOfficial/AndroidIDE/releases) for checking out whether the app files are working perfectly or not.
- If you are a basic developer then I recommend you to please just edit the project in Sketchware and generate source code and replace `app/src` with `app/src` of generated one.
